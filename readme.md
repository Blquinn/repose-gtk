# Repose

noun

> a state of rest, sleep, or tranquility.

Repose is a GTK based REST client. Being GTK based, it is cross-platform,
runs smoothly and sips electrons.

It is heavily influenced by both Postman and Insomnia, but aims to be much lighter weight.

## Features

- It can make http calls with various formats, surprise!
- Syntax highlighting
- Request Editor
- JSON path / XPath response filters for JSON and XML/HTML respectively
- WebKit based previewing for html responses

## TODO (Ideas and PRs are welcome)

- [ ] Persistence
- [ ] Scripting (Templates, variables, scripting)
- [ ] CSS selector based filtering for HTML
- [ ] Write tests
